# Icons and Splash Screens

The `convert.sh` script in this directory takes the base icon and splash PNGs and generates the appropriate sizes for the different platforms.

Run it from the project root as follows:

  cd ./app/res/ && sh convert.sh

The icon and splash screen generation used in this project is based primarily on two open source projects:
